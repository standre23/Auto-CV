# Auto-CV
1. Import packages bs4 and requests
2. Run main.py
3. Formatted cv's should then be outputted into the python directory 
4. One thing changed in main.py where the call for testing.py was replaced with a call for the new filename; create_cv.py . Done After hackathon time ended. Small mistake due to human error after 24 hrs(lowballing) no sleep that makes the code completely unable to run.
